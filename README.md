<h1>CFN CrossFit Gym</h1>
<h2>Project Goals</h2>
<p> Welcome to my first project. This website aims to provide information for people already familiar with Crossfit and want a place to further their skills, and also for people that would like to start their CrossFit journey.

Within the site you will gain insite into what CrossFit is and how it will benefit your life. Furthermore, you will be able to see when and where you can access the gym and at what times that best suit your scheduele and you will have the option to contact the gym to have any queries you may have, answered.

All of this will be achieved with styles, fonts, images and videos that will entice any potential customers to join and will be executed with simplicity not to confuse the viewer. </p>

## **Design Choices**

 

<span id="fonts"></span>

### Fonts

For the headings and sub-headings on the site I have chosen to use [Bebas Neue](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Bebas+Neue?preview.text=lato&preview.text_type=custom#standard-styles) font as I believe it is a bold and strong font that suitably represents the ideology of a gym. Through being bold and strong, this in my opinion reflects the atitude of the audience this site will attract. For other areas of text I shall use [Prompt](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Prompt?preview.text=lato&preview.text_type=custom&query=pt#standard-styles) as after researching what would work well with Bebas Neue I found this one and liked the way they looked together. 

<span id="icons"></span>

### Icons

For the icons that I am going to be using on my site I have used [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) as they have exactly what I need to complete the project at hand. I will use a number of social media icons as links and also a nu,ber of different icons to represent the different class types available at the gym.  

<span id="colors"></span>

### Colors

For this section I have chosen to use [Coolers.co](https://coolors.co/) as they have a color scheme that I think will best represent the attitude and feel of the site. The color scheme that I have chosen is as follows:

![006466](https://via.placeholder.com/50/006466/000000?text=+) `#006466`

![0b525b](https://via.placeholder.com/50/0b525b/000000?text=+) `#0b525b`

![1b3a4b](https://via.placeholder.com/50/1b3a4b/000000?text=+) `#1b3a4b`

![312244](https://via.placeholder.com/50/312244/000000?text=+) `#312244`

![3e1f47](https://via.placeholder.com/50/3e1f47/000000?text=+) `#3e1f47`

![4d194d](https://via.placeholder.com/50/4d194d/000000?text=+) `#4d194d`

https://coolors.co/palette/b7094c-a01a58-892b64-723c70-5c4d7d-455e89-2e6f95-1780a1-0091ad

I have chosen this color scheme because I believe that they represent or imply both masculine and feminine connotations throught the site. Having a dark, strong and slightly colder color for the background whilst having an electric purple to give it a bit of pop and excitement. 


<span id="structure"></span>

### Structure


| Screen Size | Breakpoint |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| x-small | <576px |
| small | >576px |
| medium | >768px |
| large | >768px |
| x-large | >1200px |

I have chosen to approach the build of my website by building it for mobile first. I will use the iPhone 5/SE (320px) as the smallest screen size for it to cater for. The screen size breakpoints above and I will be using as a reference come from [Bootstrap breakpoints](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/layout/breakpoints/)

<span id="wireframes"></span>

## **Wireframes**

The wireframe design programme that I have used for my project is [Balsamic](https://balsamiq.com/) as it is an easy to use and efficient way for me to map out how I would like my site to look. Here are the initial drawings for my site:

## **Features**

 


<span id="navigation-bar"></span>

### Navigation Bar

This is how I have designed the navigation bar for the CrossFit page:

![navigation-bar](../CFN-Project1/assets/images/CFN-one.png)

Initially I wanted to have the Navigation Bar coloured like the main logo but it did not stand out enough and was not as easy to read as I would have like it to be. This was also the case with some of the headings so I have altered it to #ffffff.
