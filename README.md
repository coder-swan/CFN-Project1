<h1>CFN CrossFit Gym</h1>
<h2>Project Goals</h2>
<p> Welcome to my first project. This website aims to provide information for people already familiar with Crossfit and want a place to further their skills, and also for people that would like to start their CrossFit journey.

Within the site you will gain insite into what CrossFit is and how it will benefit your life. Furthermore, you will be able to see when and where you can access the gym and at what times that best suit your scheduele and you will have the option to contact the gym to have any queries you may have, answered.

All of this will be achieved with styles, fonts, images and videos that will entice any potential customers to join and will be executed with simplicity not to confuse the viewer. </p>
